    LYRICS
    

    Hold me close 'til I get up
    Time is barely on our side
    I don't wanna waste what's left
    The storms we chase are leading us
    And love is all we'll ever trust, yeah
    No, I don't wanna waste what's left
    And on and on we'll go
    Through the wastelands, through the highways
    'Til my shadow turns to sunrays
    And on and on we'll go
    Through the wastelands, through the highways
    And on and on we'll go
    Oh, on we'll go
    Finding life along the way
    Melodies we haven't played
    No, I don't want no rest
    Echoing around these walls
    Fighting to create a song
    I don't wanna miss a beat
    And on and on we'll go
    Through the wastelands, through the highways
    'Til my shadow turns to sunrays
    And on and on we'll go
    Through the wastelands, through the highways
    And on and on we'll go
    And we'll grow in number
    Fueled by thunder, see the horizon
    Turn us to thousands
    And we'll grow in number
    Fueled by thunder, see the horizon
    Turn us to thousands
    And on and on we'll go
    Through the wastelands, through the highways
    'Til my shadow turns to sunrays
    And on and on we'll go
    Through the wastelands, through the highways
    And on and on we'll go</pre>
