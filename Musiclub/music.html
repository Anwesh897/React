    <p>She's got smile that it seems to me,</p>
    <p>Reminds me a childhood memories.... </p>
    <p>Where everything was as fresh as a bright blye sky,</p>
    <p>Now and then when i see her face </p>
    <p>She takes me away to that special place and if i stared to long,</p>
    <p>I probably break down and cry,</p>
    <p>ooo o oo o ,</p>
    <p>Sweet child of mine,</p>
    <p>o oo o oo,</p>
    <p>Sweet love of mine,</p>
    <p>She's got eyes of that bluest sky as if they thought of rain ,</p>
    <p>I hate to look into to those eyes and see an ounce of pain...! </p>
    <p>Her hair reminds me of a warm safe place where as a child i'd hide yie .</p>
    <p>And pray for the thunder and a rain to quitely pass me by yie .</p>
    <p>ooo o oo o,</p>
    <p>Sweet child of mine,</p>
    <p>o oo o o,</p>
    <p>Sweet love of mine...</p>
